I have forked jonnyboys newznab-tmux as he and the dev team have moved to another project (https://github.com/nZEDb/nZEDb). I will try as much as i can to maintain and improve these tmux scripts, where possible and needed, as they are a valuable addendum to newznab+.
Support is given on irc.synirc.net #tmux channel.

I started adapting some of more interesting scripts from nZEDb, but they require tempering with newznab database, so use them at your own risk. Any update to nn+ db could render them useless. Scripts require PHP version > 5.3.10 and Python 2.7x or newer.

Now, clone my github. These scripts need to run from this location and this is where I was asked to put them. If you have decided to use an alternate location, you will need to edit the file bin/config.php to point to the file newznab/www/config.php. If you do not, these scripts will not run.

  cd /var/www/newznab/misc/update_scripts/nix_scripts/
  git clone https://github.com/DariusIII/newznab-tmux.git tmux
  cd tmux

There is a lib folder in main tmux folder. In that folder you will find two folders, /DB/ and /copy_this/. if you are setting up tmux for the first time, import db.sql using cli (mysql -u {â”¤your username} -p newznab < db.sql).

1. Copy files from /lib/copy_this/ folder into your newznab installation /www folder. I have created the nntmux theme where all the settings are available.

2. Most of the scripts are now threaded, they need python installed. Install instructions are in threaded_scripts_readme.txt

3. You need to create sample folder in you covers folder (aka. /www/covers/sample) so you can have samples taken from releases, mostly XXX, and can be viewed in releases. For video previews you need video folder /www/covers/video/.

# yEnc:

  Note: You have 3 choices,
        you can install simple_php_yenc_decode which offers the best performance,
        installing yydecode, which offers good performance,
        or using PHP (no install required) which is very slow.
        You can change these at any time if you have issues with any of the 3.

  simple_php_yenc_decode:

       sudo apt-get install git
       cd ~/
       git clone https://github.com/kevinlekiller/simple_php_yenc_decode
       cd simple_php_yenc_decode/
       sh ubuntu.sh
       cd ~/
       rm -rf simple_php_yenc_decode/

  yydecode

       cd ~/
       mkdir -p yydecode
       cd yydecode/
       wget http://colocrossing.dl.sourceforge.net/project/yydecode/yydecode/0.2.10/yydecode-0.2.10.tar.gz
       tar -xzf yydecode-0.2.10.tar.gz
       cd yydecode-0.2.10/
       ./configure
       make
       sudo make install
       make clean
       cd ~/
       rm -rf yydecode/

  Note: After installing you can change the yEnc setting in tmux edit accordingly.

Tmux is started with start.php (php start.php command). Scripts not used anymore are still available for your use, but you need to run them manualy.
