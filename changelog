19.07.2013 	--> Removed nzbx_ws_hashdecrypt.php as it is no longer working.
				Added standalone hash_decrypt.php as a replacement. 
				You need do run this sql "ALTER TABLE  `releases` ADD  `dehashstatus` TINYINT( 1 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT  '0' AFTER  `haspreview`;" on newznab database if you want to run this.
